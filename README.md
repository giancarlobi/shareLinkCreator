Uploader
==================

Provides the ability to upload a directory recursively to OwnCloud.

The program expects the owncloud folder where upload and the local full path to folder

Before you can use the program you need to adjust at least the "baseURL",
"username" and "password" config parametes at the top of the script. If you
keep "username" and/or "password" empty a dialog will show up and ask for the
credentials.
